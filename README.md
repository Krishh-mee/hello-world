# hello-world
this is my first repository to get-into this github flow
I am still wondering how all of this works. Have to figure out each things and that's exactly this "hello world" repository is for. it's for documenting all the beginner stuffs. 
My goals are to be active and have a reputation on github, cause i am just explorinng Computer Science outta curiosity. And will go in as much depth as my curiosity takes. Even if that means i would become tech nerd.
I should practice making projects everyday. That contribution graph will mmotivate me to keep going and tracking my daily practice. Note- this isn't my first priority but yes it is my daily hobby.
